# Implementation of Personal Fitness Tracker using Python

## Overview
The **Personal Fitness Tracker** is an AI-powered application designed to provide **personalized fitness recommendations** based on user data and machine learning analysis. Unlike traditional fitness tracking applications that offer **generic workout plans**, this system **customizes exercise routines, predicts calorie burn, and suggests activities** based on individual preferences, fitness levels, and real-time data from wearable devices (if available).

## Objective
The goal of this project is to **enhance fitness tracking accuracy and personalization** by utilizing **machine learning algorithms**. The system allows users to **set fitness goals, track their progress, and receive tailored workout suggestions**, improving adherence to fitness plans and motivation levels.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Machine Learning Framework**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regression, Classification models)  
- **User Interface**: Streamlit  
- **Development Environment**: VS Code  
- **Data Collection**: User inputs, wearable device data (steps, heart rate)  

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Users input fitness goals, activity levels, and workout preferences. Wearable device data is also integrated if available.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Relevant features such as BMI, daily steps, heart rate, and workout duration are processed.  
3. **Machine Learning Models** –  
   - **Classification Models** suggest customized workout plans.  
   - **Regression Models** predict calorie burn and fitness progression.  
   - **Recommendation Systems** provide exercise recommendations based on past performance.  
4. **User Interaction & Deployment** – The system is deployed via **Streamlit**, offering an intuitive interface for users to track progress and receive recommendations.  

## Key Features & Benefits
✔ **Personalized Workout Plans** – AI-driven customization ensures that exercises match user capabilities.  
✔ **Calorie Burn Prediction** – Helps users adjust diet and exercise routines for optimal results.  
✔ **Wearable Device Integration** – Supports real-time data tracking for enhanced accuracy.  
✔ **User-Friendly Interface** – Accessible to users with minimal technical expertise.
